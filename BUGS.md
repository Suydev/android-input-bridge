## BUG-001 — DiagnosticsManager.flushCounters() name shadow in lambda

**Description**: Inside the `DiagnosticsData.() -> DiagnosticsData` update lambda,
`packetsSent` and `packetsReceived` resolved to the data class fields (type `Long`)
instead of the outer `AtomicLong` objects, causing `Unresolved reference 'get'` at
compile time.

**Steps to reproduce**: Build the project with `./gradlew :app-bridge:assembleDebug`.

**Expected behavior**: Compilation succeeds.
**Actual behavior**: `e: Unresolved reference 'get'` on DiagnosticsManager.kt:39, 40.

**Suspected cause**: Kotlin lambda scoping — inside an extension lambda `T.() -> T`,
any property of `T` shadows outer-scope names with the same identifier.

**Files involved**: `diagnostics/src/main/kotlin/com/inputbridge/diagnostics/DiagnosticsManager.kt`

**Priority**: Critical (blocks CI)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (commit `774ba97`)
**Fix**: Capture atomic values as `val sent = packetsSent.get()` etc. before entering the lambda.

---

## BUG-002 — InputBridgeAccessibilityService duplicate companion object

**Description**: Two `companion object` blocks declared in the same class. Kotlin only
allows one companion object per class. `TAP_DURATION_MS` was in the second block and
the singleton `instance` was in the first.

**Steps to reproduce**: Build the project.

**Expected behavior**: Compilation succeeds.
**Actual behavior**: `e: Only one companion object is allowed per class` + `Conflicting declarations`.

**Files involved**: `accessibility-receiver/.../InputBridgeAccessibilityService.kt`

**Priority**: Critical (blocks CI)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (commit `774ba97`)
**Fix**: Merged `TAP_DURATION_MS` into the first companion object and removed the second block.

---

## BUG-003 — UsbInputCapture invalid coroutine active check

**Description**: USB polling loops used `isActive(coroutineContext)` which is not a
valid Kotlin coroutines API.

**Steps to reproduce**: Build the project.

**Expected behavior**: Compilation succeeds.
**Actual behavior**: `e: Unresolved reference. None of the following candidates is applicable
because of a receiver type mismatch` on UsbInputCapture.kt lines 115, 156, 194.

**Files involved**: `input-capture/.../UsbInputCapture.kt`

**Priority**: Critical (blocks CI)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (commit `774ba97`)
**Fix**: Changed to `this@UsbInputCapture.isActive && coroutineContext.isActive`
(class field + coroutine extension property on `CoroutineContext`).

---

## BUG-004 — app-receiver AAPT theme resource not found

**Description**: `app-receiver/res/values/themes.xml` referenced
`android:Theme.Material.NoTitleBar.Fullscreen` as the parent style, which is not
resolvable via AAPT in the AGP 8.4.2 / compileSdk 35 configuration used.

**Steps to reproduce**: Build the project after fixing BUG-001/002/003.

**Expected behavior**: Resource linking succeeds.
**Actual behavior**: `ERROR: AAPT: error: resource android:style/Theme.Material.NoTitleBar.Fullscreen not found.`

**Files involved**: `app-receiver/src/main/res/values/themes.xml`

**Priority**: Critical (blocks CI)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (commit `8dbec88`)
**Fix**: Changed parent to `Theme.Material3.Dark.NoActionBar` (consistent with
app-bridge; provided by the `androidx.compose.material3` dependency already declared
in app-receiver).

---

## BUG-005 — BuildConfig not generated (missing buildFeatures flag)

**Description**: Both app modules referenced `BuildConfig.DEBUG`, `BuildConfig.VERSION_NAME`,
`BuildConfig.VERSION_CODE` but the class was never generated because
`buildFeatures { buildConfig = true }` was absent from the convention plugin.

**Steps to reproduce**: Build the project after fixing BUG-004.

**Expected behavior**: `BuildConfig` class is generated and importable.
**Actual behavior**: `e: Unresolved reference 'BuildConfig'` in BridgeApplication, ReceiverApplication, AboutScreen.

**Files involved**: `build-logic/src/main/kotlin/AndroidAppConventionPlugin.kt`

**Priority**: Critical (blocks CI)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (commit `9931cb8`)
**Fix**: Added `buildFeatures { buildConfig = true }` inside `extensions.configure<ApplicationExtension>`.

---

## BUG-006 — androidContext() unresolved in Koin module files

**Description**: `BridgeModule.kt` and `ReceiverModule.kt` used `androidContext()` inside
the Koin `module { }` DSL without importing the function. The import
`org.koin.android.ext.koin.androidContext` was missing.

**Steps to reproduce**: Build the project after fixing BUG-005.

**Expected behavior**: Compilation succeeds.
**Actual behavior**: `e: Unresolved reference 'androidContext'` in BridgeModule and ReceiverModule.

**Files involved**: `app-bridge/.../di/BridgeModule.kt`, `app-receiver/.../di/ReceiverModule.kt`

**Priority**: Critical (blocks CI)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (commit `9931cb8`)
**Fix**: Added `import org.koin.android.ext.koin.androidContext` to both module files.

---

## BUG-007 — ReceiverService uses non-existent system drawable

**Description**: `ReceiverService.buildNotification()` referenced
`android.R.drawable.ic_menu_receive` which does not exist in the Android SDK.
This caused an overload resolution ambiguity error on `setSmallIcon`.

**Steps to reproduce**: Build the project after fixing BUG-006.

**Expected behavior**: Compilation succeeds.
**Actual behavior**: `e: Overload resolution ambiguity` + `e: Unresolved reference 'ic_menu_receive'`.

**Files involved**: `app-receiver/.../service/ReceiverService.kt`

**Priority**: Critical (blocks CI)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (commit `9931cb8`)
**Fix**: Replaced `android.R.drawable.ic_menu_receive` with `android.R.drawable.ic_menu_send`
(exists in all SDK versions, also used by BridgeService).

---

## BUG-008 — BridgeService/ReceiverService teardown race

**Description**: Original `onDestroy()` launched cleanup coroutines on `serviceScope`
and then immediately called `serviceScope.cancel()`, so the cleanup coroutines were
cancelled before they could run. USB capture and UDP socket could remain open after
service stop, causing port-bind failures or stale resources on restart.

**Files involved**: `app-bridge/.../service/BridgeService.kt`, `app-receiver/.../service/ReceiverService.kt`

**Priority**: High
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (commit `5e9b520`, refined in `a93b48e`)
**Fix**: Cancel individual jobs first, then run resource cleanup in
`withContext(NonCancellable + Dispatchers.IO)` with `runBlocking`, then cancel `serviceScope`.

---

## BUG-010 — accessibility-receiver missing :diagnostics dependency

**Description**: `accessibility-receiver/build.gradle.kts` did not declare
`implementation(project(":diagnostics"))`, but `InputBridgeAccessibilityService.kt`
imports and uses `DiagnosticsManager` (from the diagnostics module) in
`onServiceConnected()` and `onUnbind()`.

**Steps to reproduce**: Build any module that depends on accessibility-receiver.

**Expected behavior**: Compilation succeeds.
**Actual behavior**: `e: Unresolved reference 'DiagnosticsManager'` in
InputBridgeAccessibilityService.kt lines 72–85.

**Files involved**: `accessibility-receiver/build.gradle.kts`

**Priority**: Critical (blocks CI for commit 2bc466f)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (session 006)
**Fix**: Added `implementation(project(":diagnostics"))` to the dependencies block.

---

## BUG-011 — AccessibilityNodeInfo.ACTION_SELECT_ALL does not exist in Android SDK

**Description**: `InputBridgeAccessibilityService.handleCtrlKey()` referenced
`AccessibilityNodeInfo.ACTION_SELECT_ALL` for the Ctrl+A (select-all) shortcut.
This constant does not exist in the Android SDK — it was confused with a non-existent symbol.

**Steps to reproduce**: Build the project.

**Expected behavior**: Compilation succeeds.
**Actual behavior**: `e: Unresolved reference 'ACTION_SELECT_ALL'` at
`InputBridgeAccessibilityService.kt:407:80`.

**Files involved**: `accessibility-receiver/.../InputBridgeAccessibilityService.kt`

**Priority**: Critical (blocks CI — all runs #27–#31 failed because of this)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (session 008)
**Fix**: Replace with `AccessibilityNodeInfo.ACTION_SET_SELECTION` passing a Bundle with
`ACTION_ARGUMENT_SELECTION_START_INT = 0` and `ACTION_ARGUMENT_SELECTION_END_INT = text.length`.
Both constants exist since API 18 and are stable through API 35.

---


## BUG-012 — transport-bluetooth-hid missing :diagnostics dependency

**Description**: `transport-bluetooth-hid/build.gradle.kts` did not declare
`implementation(project(":diagnostics"))`, but `BluetoothHidTransport.kt` imports
and uses `DiagnosticsManager` (from the diagnostics module) for `btConnected`/
`btDeviceName` updates in `onConnectionStateChanged()`, `handleHostConnected()`, and
`disconnect()`.

**Steps to reproduce**: Build any module that depends on transport-bluetooth-hid.

**Expected behavior**: Compilation succeeds.
**Actual behavior**:
```
e: BluetoothHidTransport.kt:13:24 Unresolved reference 'diagnostics'.
e: BluetoothHidTransport.kt:121:21 Unresolved reference 'DiagnosticsManager'.
e: BluetoothHidTransport.kt:266:13 Unresolved reference 'DiagnosticsManager'.
e: BluetoothHidTransport.kt:336:9  Unresolved reference 'DiagnosticsManager'.
```

**Files involved**: `transport-bluetooth-hid/build.gradle.kts`

**Priority**: Critical (blocks CI run #34)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (session 009)
**Fix**: Added `implementation(project(":diagnostics"))` to the dependencies block.
Pattern is identical to BUG-010 (accessibility-receiver missing :diagnostics).

---

## BUG-013 — device_filter.xml used placeholder vendor/product IDs

**Description**: `app-bridge/src/main/res/xml/device_filter.xml` had hardcoded
`vendor-id="1234" product-id="5678"` — placeholder values that match no real device.
The `USB_DEVICE_ATTACHED` intent was therefore never delivered to `MainActivity`, so the
app never knew when the Portronics Key2 Combo was plugged in.

**Files involved**: `app-bridge/src/main/res/xml/device_filter.xml`

**Priority**: Critical (USB auto-detection completely broken)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 011)
**Fix**: Replaced vendor/product filter with `<usb-device class="3" />` (any USB HID class
device). BridgeService validates `interfaceClass == USB_CLASS_HID` at runtime.

---

## BUG-014 — ReceiverService missing POST_NOTIFICATIONS runtime flow (Android 13+)

**Description**: The receiver app declared `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` in its manifest but had
no `ReceiverPermissionsScreen` to guide the user through granting it. On Android 13+
(OnePlus Pad Go target), `startForeground()` in a service started without the notification
permission produces a silent failure that leaves the notification missing.

**Files involved**: `app-receiver/src/main/kotlin/.../ui/screens/ReceiverPermissionsScreen.kt` (missing)

**Priority**: High
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 011)
**Fix**: Created `ReceiverPermissionsScreen.kt` with `rememberLauncherForActivityResult`
for `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`. Wired into `MainActivity` nav as `ReceiverRoute.PERMISSIONS`.

---

## BUG-015 — ReceiverService foreground service type was `dataSync` (Android 14+ cap)

**Description**: `app-receiver/AndroidManifest.xml` declared `foregroundServiceType="dataSync"`
for `ReceiverService`. Android 14+ caps `dataSync` services at 6 hours/day. A bridging
session can run many hours continuously.

**Files involved**: `app-receiver/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

**Priority**: High
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 011)
**Fix**: Changed `foregroundServiceType` to `connectedDevice`. Updated the
corresponding `<uses-permission>` to `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_CONNECTED_DEVICE`.
`connectedDevice` has no runtime cap and correctly describes the use case.

---

## BUG-016 — See BUG-013 (same root cause, same fix)

**Status**: ✅ FIXED (duplicate of BUG-013)

---

## BUG-017 — ReceiverService WelcomeScreen "Boot Auto-start" showed wrong field

**Description**: `WelcomeScreen.kt` (receiver) was reading `diagnostics.batteryOptimizationIgnored`
for the "Boot Auto-start" status row — a completely unrelated field. The indicator was
therefore always wrong (almost always `false` on fresh installs).

**Files involved**: `app-receiver/.../ui/screens/WelcomeScreen.kt`

**Priority**: Medium (UI misinformation)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 011)
**Fix**: Changed to `config.display.autoStartOnBoot` (from the ViewModel's `AppConfig`)
which directly reflects the persisted `ReceiverPreferences.autoStartOnBoot` value.

---

## BUG-018 — Brightness slider "dead zone" (11 of 22 steps all mapped to System default)

**Description**: The old brightness slider used `valueRange = -1f..1f` with snap logic that
mapped all negative values to `-1f` (system default). This created 11 dead positions on the
left half of the slider. Users saw the slider start at ~33% and couldn't reach intermediate
negative values.

**Files involved**: `app-bridge/.../ui/screens/SettingsScreen.kt`

**Priority**: Medium (confusing UX)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 011)
**Fix**: Replaced with: (a) a dedicated "Use System Brightness" toggle, and (b) a
clean `0f..1f` slider (5% increments) that only appears when the toggle is off.

---

## BUG-019 — WelcomeScreen (receiver) "Network Ready" hardcoded `true`

**Description**: Both `WelcomeScreen.kt` files showed "Network Ready" as always-true,
regardless of whether Wi-Fi or Ethernet was actually available.

**Files involved**: `app-receiver/.../ui/screens/WelcomeScreen.kt`,
`app-bridge/.../ui/screens/WelcomeScreen.kt`

**Priority**: Medium (misleading status)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 011)
**Fix**: Added `_isNetworkAvailable: MutableStateFlow<Boolean>` to `ReceiverViewModel`
(and `BridgeViewModel`). Value is computed from `ConnectivityManager.getNetworkCapabilities()`
checking `TRANSPORT_WIFI` or `TRANSPORT_ETHERNET`. Refreshed on every `ON_RESUME`.

---

## BUG-020 — Receiver app had no PermissionsScreen

**Description**: The bridge app has had `PermissionsScreen` since Phase 5, guiding the user
through battery optimization, Bluetooth, and notification permissions. The receiver app had
no equivalent, leaving users without guidance for the same critical permissions.

**Files involved**: `app-receiver/` (missing `ReceiverPermissionsScreen.kt`)

**Priority**: High
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 011)
**Fix**: Created `ReceiverPermissionsScreen.kt` covering: Accessibility service, battery
optimization exemption, `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` (API 33+), `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` (overlay),
and MIUI/OxygenOS/ColorOS autostart guidance. Wired in `MainActivity` + `WelcomeScreen`.

---

## BUG-021 — Receiver app missing battery optimization exemption guidance

**Description**: Sub-case of BUG-020. The receiver app never prompted the user to request
battery optimization exemption, making the service extremely fragile on MIUI and ColorOS.

**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 011) — covered by `ReceiverPermissionsScreen`.

---

## BUG-022 — `batteryOptimizationIgnored` never updated at runtime (receiver)

**Description**: `DiagnosticsData.batteryOptimizationIgnored` was set to its default `false`
and never updated by the receiver side. The diagnostics screen and WelcomeScreen status row
always showed the battery optimization as "not ignored" even when the user had granted it.

**Files involved**: `app-receiver/.../viewmodel/ReceiverViewModel.kt`

**Priority**: High
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 011)
**Fix**: Added `refreshStatus()` to `ReceiverViewModel` that calls
`PowerManager.isIgnoringBatteryOptimizations()` and pushes the result into
`DiagnosticsManager`. Called on `init` and on every `Lifecycle.Event.ON_RESUME` from
`WelcomeScreen`.

---

## BUG-023 — No network setup guide for users

**Description**: Users had no guidance on how to connect bridge phone and receiver tablet.
The bridge SettingsScreen had only a blank IP field with a placeholder.

**Files involved**: `app-bridge/.../ui/screens/SettingsScreen.kt`

**Priority**: Medium (first-run UX blocker)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 011)
**Fix**: Added a "NETWORK SETUP" card above the IP field explaining three connection
options: tablet-as-hotspot (recommended, pre-fills `192.168.43.1`), same router, and
phone-as-hotspot.

---

## BUG-024 — No guidance that BT HID mode does not need the receiver app

**Description**: Users who enable Bluetooth HID mode on the bridge still have the receiver
app installed and are confused about whether they need to run it. The receiver app provides
no explanation of this mode.

**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 011)
**Fix**: Added explanatory text to the BT HID section of `SettingsScreen.kt`:
"Note: in BT HID mode the receiver app (on the tablet) is NOT needed. The phone connects
directly as a Bluetooth keyboard+mouse."

---

## BUG-025 — Unused `WRITE_SETTINGS` permission in bridge manifest

**Description**: `app-bridge/AndroidManifest.xml` declared `android.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS`
which was never requested or used. Screen brightness is applied via `WindowManager.LayoutParams`
(per-window override) which requires no special permission.

**Files involved**: `app-bridge/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

**Priority**: Low (unnecessary permission, lint warning, potential Play Store concern)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 011)
**Fix**: Removed `WRITE_SETTINGS` from the manifest. Left a comment explaining that
`WindowManager.LayoutParams.screenBrightness` is used instead.

---

## BUG-026 — `accessibility_service_config.xml` missing `canRetrieveWindowContent`

**Description**: Without `android:canRetrieveWindowContent="true"` in the accessibility
service config, `rootInActiveWindow` returns `null` for normal (non-accessibility-focused)
apps. Every call to `injectKeyCode()` and `injectText()` starts with a null check on
`rootInActiveWindow` — meaning ALL keyboard injection, text injection, Ctrl shortcuts,
and arrow-key movement were silently blocked. Only gesture injection (tap, swipe) and
global navigation (BACK, HOME, RECENTS) worked without this flag.

**Files involved**: `app-receiver/src/main/res/xml/accessibility_service_config.xml`

**Priority**: Critical (keyboard injection completely non-functional)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 011)
**Fix**: Added `android:canRetrieveWindowContent="true"` to the config.

---

## BUG-027 — `UsbInputCapture` uses `bulkTransfer()` on interrupt endpoints

**Description**: `UsbInputCapture.readKeyboard()` and `readMouse()` call
`UsbDeviceConnection.bulkTransfer(endpoint, ...)` but the endpoint is of type
`USB_ENDPOINT_XFER_INT` (interrupt), not bulk. Semantically, `UsbRequest` with
`requestWait()` is the correct API for interrupt endpoints, as it is properly
interrupt-driven rather than polling.

**Actual impact**: On Android, `bulkTransfer()` works on interrupt endpoints in practice
(the HAL handles both transfer types). The 50ms timeout causes the loop to poll ~20×/sec
even when no input is occurring, wasting some CPU. Input is NOT non-functional — all
keyboard/mouse events are captured correctly.

**Files involved**: `input-capture/.../UsbInputCapture.kt`

**Priority**: Low (semantically incorrect but functionally correct on Android)
**Status**: ⏳ DEFERRED (Phase 8)
**Reason for deferral**: Switching to `UsbRequest` with a shared `UsbDeviceConnection`
requires a demultiplexer (both keyboard and mouse requests share one connection;
`requestWait()` returns whichever completes first and the caller must route by endpoint).
The refactor adds complexity and a new failure mode. Given that the current approach works
correctly on the target hardware, this is deferred to avoid regression risk.
**Future fix**: Refactor `start()` to open one `UsbRequest` per interface endpoint, use a
single `requestWait()` dispatcher coroutine, route completions to per-endpoint `Channel<ByteArray>`,
and remove the 50ms timeout spinning.

---

## BUG-028 — See BUG-022 (same root cause, same fix)

**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 011) — duplicate of BUG-022.

---

## BUG-029 — See BUG-018 (same root cause, same fix)

**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 011) — duplicate of BUG-018.

---

## BUG-030 — Scroll sensitivity not wired to `scrollSensitivity` field

**Description**: `MouseConfig.scrollSensitivity` is defined but `AccessibilityCommandBus`
applies `mouseSensitivity` to scroll events instead of a dedicated scroll sensitivity.
The `ReceiverSettingsScreen` scroll sensitivity slider existed but only controlled mouse
move sensitivity.

**Files involved**: `shared-core/.../AppConfig.kt`, `accessibility-receiver/.../AccessibilityCommandBus.kt`

**Priority**: Low (scroll speed not separately tunable)
**Status**: ⏳ DEFERRED (Phase 8)
**Reason**: The current single sensitivity knob is functional. A separate scroll sensitivity
requires a new `ReceiverPreferences` key, a new `ReceiverViewModel` setter, a new slider in
`ReceiverSettingsScreen`, and wiring through `AccessibilityCommandBus`. This is a clean feature
addition, not a crash fix — deferred to Phase 8.

---

## BUG-031 — STOP button visible when service is not running

**Description**: `ConnectionScreen.kt` (receiver) always rendered the STOP `TextButton`,
even when `isReceiverActive == false`. Tapping STOP when the service was not running sent a
stop intent to a non-running service — no crash, but confusing empty-state semantics.
Symmetrically, the bridge `BridgeScreen.kt` showed STOP based on
`diagnostics.bridgeServiceRunning` which could be stale.

**Files involved**: `app-receiver/.../ui/screens/ConnectionScreen.kt`,
`app-bridge/.../ui/screens/BridgeScreen.kt`

**Priority**: Medium (confusing UX)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 011)
**Fix**: Both screens: STOP button now only renders when the service is confirmed active
(`isReceiverActive == true` / `isBridgeActive || diagnostics.bridgeServiceRunning`). START
button renders in the complementary state. Emergency stop (Volume Down × 3s) remains
available at all times regardless of UI state.

---

## BUG-032 — USB PendingIntent FLAG_IMMUTABLE blocks permission result delivery (Android 12+)

**Description**: `BridgeService.requestUsbPermission()` created its PendingIntent with
`PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE`. On Android 12+ (API 31+), the Android USB system must write
`EXTRA_PERMISSION_GRANTED` and `EXTRA_DEVICE` extras into the PendingIntent before delivering
the broadcast. Immutable PendingIntents block those writes. As a result, the broadcast receiver
always saw `granted = false` (the default) even when the user tapped "Allow" on the permission
dialog. This manifested as: user grants USB permission → dialog dismisses → app still shows
"USB device not found" or "USB permission denied" → repeated permission dialogs.

**Root cause**: Android requires `FLAG_MUTABLE` for PendingIntents where the system needs to fill
in extras. USB permission result delivery is one of the canonical use-cases listed in the docs.

**Files involved**: `app-bridge/src/main/kotlin/com/inputbridge/bridge/service/BridgeService.kt`

**Priority**: Critical (USB capture completely non-functional — all keyboard/mouse input dead)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 012)
**Fix**: Changed to `PendingIntent.FLAG_MUTABLE` on API 31+, `0` on older versions. Added
a clear comment explaining why this flag is mandatory for USB permission intents.

---

## BUG-033 — startForegroundService() crashes on Android 12+ when called from background

**Description**: Both `BridgeViewModel.startBridge()` and `ReceiverViewModel.startReceiver()`
call `context.startForegroundService()` inside `viewModelScope.launch {}` with no exception
handling. On Android 12+ (API 31+), calling `startForegroundService()` while the app is in the
background (any transient background moment — screen-off, activity paused) throws
`ForegroundServiceStartNotAllowedException`. With `SupervisorJob` the failed child coroutine
does not propagate to cancel the ViewModel, but the unhandled exception goes to the global
uncaught exception handler and crashes the app.

**User symptom**: App crashes when pressing START button. Also affects STOP button which
calls `startService()` with an ACTION_STOP intent — same exception risk.

**Files involved**:
- `app-bridge/.../viewmodel/BridgeViewModel.kt`
- `app-receiver/.../viewmodel/ReceiverViewModel.kt`

**Priority**: Critical (START/STOP buttons crash the app)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 012)
**Fix**: Wrapped all `startForegroundService()` and `startService()` calls in `runCatching {}`.
Failures are logged via `BridgeLogger` and surfaced into `DiagnosticsManager.lastError` so the
UI can show the user what went wrong rather than crashing silently.

---

## BUG-034 — Bridge sensitivity slider is a complete no-op (scaling never applied)

**Description**: `BridgePreferences.bridgeSensitivity` is stored and shown on the Settings
screen, and `BridgeViewModel.setBridgeSensitivity()` persists changes. However, `BridgeService.
startCapture()` forwarded raw `InputEvent` objects directly from `UsbInputCapture.events` to the
transport without ever reading `prefs.bridgeSensitivity` or scaling `MouseMove.dx/dy`. Moving the
sensitivity slider had zero effect on actual mouse movement speed.

**Files involved**: `app-bridge/.../service/BridgeService.kt`

**Priority**: High (bridge-side sensitivity slider completely non-functional)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 012)
**Fix**: In `startCapture()`, before dispatching each event, check if `prefs.bridgeSensitivity ≠ 1.0f`
and if the event is a `MouseMove`. If so, return `event.copy(dx = dx * s, dy = dy * s)`.
Applied both to BT HID and UDP paths (the scaled event replaces the raw one for both).

---

## BUG-035 — POST_NOTIFICATIONS never requested at first launch

**Description**: Both apps declare `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` in their manifests and have a
PermissionsScreen that can request it. However, neither app proactively requests the permission
at first launch. Users must discover and navigate to PermissionsScreen manually. On Android 13+
(OnePlus Pad Go target), without `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`, the foreground service notification is
silently suppressed. On some OEM ROMs (OnePlus OxygenOS), a foreground service without a
visible notification is treated as a background service and may be killed.

**User symptom**: Service appears to start (no crash) but no notification appears, service is
killed after a few minutes, bridge appears to disconnect randomly.

**Files involved**:
- `app-bridge/.../ui/MainActivity.kt`
- `app-receiver/.../ui/MainActivity.kt`

**Priority**: High
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 012)
**Fix**: Added `notificationPermLauncher` (ActivityResultContracts.RequestPermission) in both
MainActivity classes. Called `requestNotificationPermissionIfNeeded()` from `onCreate()`. Only
requests if API ≥ 33 and permission not already granted. System dialog shows only once (Android
caches the result); subsequent launches skip the launcher call entirely.

---

## BUG-036 — Receiver app shows no information about BT HID mode

**Description**: When the bridge is configured for BT HID mode, the receiver app is not needed.
However, the receiver's ConnectionScreen shows "Waiting for bridge…" indefinitely with no
explanation. Users setting up BT HID mode would:
1. Install receiver on the tablet
2. Open it, see "Waiting for bridge…"
3. Enable the Accessibility service (not needed for BT HID)
4. Start the receiver service (also not needed)
5. Still never see a connection — no explanation why

**Files involved**: `app-receiver/.../ui/screens/ConnectionScreen.kt`

**Priority**: Medium (UX confusion, not a crash)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 012)
**Fix**: Added a permanent info card at the bottom of ConnectionScreen explaining: in BT HID mode
the receiver app is NOT needed; the bridge phone pairs directly as a Bluetooth keyboard+mouse via
Settings → Bluetooth on the tablet. Card is always visible so it doesn't require any state from
the bridge.

---

## BUG-037 — Brightness pref shows stale value from old slider (starts at 33%)

**Description**: The old brightness slider used `valueRange = -1f..1f`. If the user had
touched it, a positive float (e.g. `0.33f`) could be stored in SharedPreferences. After the
Phase 7 redesign (toggle + 0–1 slider), the new code correctly reads the stored `0.33f` and
displays "Use System Brightness = OFF, 33%". The user perceives this as "slider starts at 33%".

**Files involved**: `app-bridge/.../prefs/BridgePreferences.kt`

**Priority**: Low (cosmetic — only affects upgrades from pre-Phase-7 installs)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 012)
**Fix**: Added a migration sentinel key (`brightness_v2_migrated`) to `BridgePreferences`. On
first read after upgrade (sentinel absent), if the stored value is positive (meaning it was
explicitly set with the old slider), it is reset to `-1f` (system default) and the sentinel is
written. Fresh installs are unaffected (default is already `-1f`).

---

## BUG-009 — BridgeService/ReceiverService duplicate pipeline on repeated starts

**Description**: `onStartCommand()` launched `startPipeline()` / `startListening()`
unconditionally. Two rapid `onStartCommand` calls (e.g. BootReceiver + user tap)
could both pass the guard (originally set inside the coroutine, too late) and create
duplicate flush loops and transport instances.

**Files involved**: `app-bridge/.../service/BridgeService.kt`, `app-receiver/.../service/ReceiverService.kt`

**Priority**: High
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (commit `a93b48e`)
**Fix**: `AtomicBoolean.compareAndSet(false, true)` in `onStartCommand` before
launching the coroutine, so exactly one caller wins the CAS and starts the pipeline.
Reset to false in `onDestroy` and on failed startup paths.

---

## BUG-038 — KeyMap missing ~20 key codes (numpad, F13–F24, Insert, Pause, Application)

**Description**: `KeyMap.HID_TO_ANDROID` (input-capture module) was missing the following HID
Keyboard/Keypad page usage IDs:
- Numpad cluster: Num Lock, `/`, `*`, `-`, `+`, Enter, 1–9, 0, `.` (0x53–0x63)
- Insert (0x49)
- Print Screen / SysRq (0x46)
- Scroll Lock (0x47)
- Pause / Break (0x48)
- Application / Menu key (0x65)
- F13–F24 (0x68–0x73)

Any USB keyboard key in these ranges was silently converted to `KEYCODE_UNKNOWN` and dropped.
This meant the full numpad was non-functional over USB capture.

**Note**: `HidReportBuilder.ANDROID_TO_HID` (transport-bluetooth-hid module) already contained
the numpad and navigation mappings, so BT HID was not affected — only USB capture.

**Files involved**: `input-capture/.../KeyMap.kt`

**Priority**: High (entire numpad non-functional over USB)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 013)
**Fix**: Added all missing HID → Android mappings. Documented that Consumer Control media
keys (volume, play/pause) require a separate usage page (0x0C) and are not included here.

## BUG-039 — UsbInputCapture interface detection only checks subclass, misses protocol=0 combo receivers

**Description**: `UsbInputCapture` determined whether each HID interface was a keyboard or mouse
solely by `interfaceSubclass`:

```kotlin
SUBCLASS_KEYBOARD → readKeyboard(...)
SUBCLASS_MOUSE    → readMouse(...)
else              → readGenericHid(...)  // was a no-op!
```

`readGenericHid` was a stub — it logged a warning and immediately returned, silently swallowing
all input from the interface. Some combo USB receivers (including certain configurations of the
Portronics Key2 Combo) enumerate with `subclass=0` (HID Boot Interface not declared) while still
sending standard boot-protocol 8-byte keyboard or 4-byte mouse reports. When this happens both
interfaces hit the `else` branch and all keyboard and mouse input is dropped with no visible error.

**Files involved**: `input-capture/.../UsbInputCapture.kt`

**Priority**: Critical (the entire bridge may produce zero output with the Portronics receiver)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 013)
**Fix**: Extended detection logic to also check `interfaceProtocol` (1=keyboard, 2=mouse) as a
fallback when `interfaceSubclass` is not the boot subclass (1). Added a third heuristic:
`maxPacketSize ≤ 6` indicates a mouse report (boot mouse is 3–5 bytes; keyboard is always 8).
Final fallback treats unknown interfaces as keyboard rather than discarding them.
Also removed the dead `readGenericHid` stub.
Also added 5-byte extended mouse report support (HID tilt-wheel / panning).

## BUG-040 — BridgeService.onDestroy never sends DISCONNECT packet

**Description**: When BridgeService is stopped (user taps STOP, system reclaims, battery kill),
`onDestroy()` immediately cancels all jobs and closes the UDP socket. The receiver app never
receives a DISCONNECT packet and continues showing "Bridge connected" for the next 15 seconds
until the PING watchdog fires.

This is particularly confusing in normal stop/start workflows: the user stops the bridge on the
Redmi, then immediately goes to the tablet — which still shows "Connected" for a full 15 seconds.

**Files involved**: `app-bridge/.../service/BridgeService.kt`

**Priority**: Medium (UX degradation — user confusion, not a crash)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 013)
**Fix**: In `onDestroy()`, before calling `udpTransport.disconnect()`, call
`udpTransport.send(packetFactory.makeDisconnect())` and delay 60 ms inside a `NonCancellable`
coroutine context so the datagram is sent before the socket closes. On the receiver side,
the existing DISCONNECT handler already handles this correctly (clears pairing, updates UI).

---

## BUG-041 — ReceiverService has no watchdog for bridge silence

**Description**: `ReceiverService` had no mechanism to detect a silently-dead bridge. If the
bridge crashed, lost Wi-Fi, or was killed by the OS without sending DISCONNECT, the receiver
would stay in "Connected / Paired" state indefinitely with no notification to the user.

The receiver would only recover if:
1. The bridge explicitly sent DISCONNECT on stop (which BUG-040 shows it didn't), OR
2. The user manually stopped and restarted the receiver service.

**Files involved**: `app-receiver/.../service/ReceiverService.kt`

**Priority**: High (silent indefinite failure state — user cannot know bridge is gone)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 013)
**Fix**: Added `lastPingReceivedMs` timestamp that is updated on every received PING.
Added `watchdogJob` coroutine (runs every `BRIDGE_WATCHDOG_CHECK_MS` = 5 s).
If `System.currentTimeMillis() - lastPingReceivedMs > BRIDGE_SILENCE_TIMEOUT_MS` (15 s) and
at least one PING has been seen, the watchdog:
1. Updates the foreground notification: "Bridge silent for Xs — check connection"
2. Sets `DiagnosticsManager.lastError` and `transportConnected = false`
3. Sets `bridgeSilenceNotified = true` to avoid repeated notifications
When a PING is received again (bridge reconnected), `bridgeSilenceNotified` is reset and the
notification is restored to normal.

## BUG-042 — AccessibilityCommandBus routes MouseMove through coroutine queue (added latency)

**Description**: All `InputEvent` types including `MouseMove` were emitted into a
`MutableSharedFlow` and processed by a coroutine on `Dispatchers.Main`. This added ~1–2 ms of
coroutine dispatch overhead per mouse-move event. At 125 Hz USB polling (8 ms per event), this
overhead is significant (12–25% of the inter-event budget) and contributes to cursor lag.

**Files involved**: `accessibility-receiver/.../AccessibilityCommandBus.kt`

**Priority**: Medium (latency/smoothness — not a correctness bug)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 013)
**Fix**: `post(event: InputEvent)` now handles `InputEvent.MouseMove` inline on the calling
thread (IO coroutine from ReceiverService), updating `cursorX`, `cursorY`, and the
`_cursorPosition` StateFlow directly. `MutableStateFlow.value` is thread-safe; the
`CursorOverlayService` collects the StateFlow on Main and updates the overlay position on the
next frame without requiring explicit Main-thread dispatch. All other event types continue
through the coroutine queue to preserve ordering with clicks, scrolls, and keyboard events.

---

## BUG-043 — Cursor overlay shows green crosshair dot, not a Windows-style arrow cursor

**Description**: `CursorOverlayService` showed a semi-transparent green dot with crosshair lines.
The user explicitly requested a Windows-like arrow cursor pointer shape.

Additionally, the view was centred on the cursor position using an offset of `-(width/2, height/2)`.
An arrow cursor's hotspot should be at the TIP (top-left corner of the view), not the centre, so
the centering offset was incorrect for an arrow shape.

**Files involved**: `app-receiver/.../service/CursorOverlayService.kt`

**Priority**: Medium (usability — user cannot accurately see click target)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 013)
**Fix**: Replaced `CursorDotView` with `CursorArrowView`. The new view draws the classic
Windows arrow cursor shape using `android.graphics.Path`:
- Tip at canvas (0,0) — that is the hotspot
- White fill with thin black outline for visibility on any background
- Drop shadow (semi-transparent dark fill, 1dp offset) for depth
- View sized at 36dp × 36dp
The overlay position is now `params.x = cursorX.toInt(), params.y = cursorY.toInt()` (no centring
offset), so the arrow tip lands exactly at the logical cursor coordinates.

---

## BUG-044 — No global crash handler — crashes silent, no diagnostic data written

**Description**: Neither `BridgeApplication` nor `ReceiverApplication` registered a global
`Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler`. When any thread crashed with an unhandled exception, the
Android default handler showed a dialog but nothing was written to `DiagnosticsManager` or
`BridgeLogger`. The user had no way to see what happened without logcat.

**Files involved**: `app-bridge/.../BridgeApplication.kt`, `app-receiver/.../ReceiverApplication.kt`

**Priority**: Medium (debuggability — without crash capture, silent failures are invisible)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 013)
**Fix**: Both Application classes now save the previous handler and register a new one before
Koin initialisation (so DI crashes are captured too). The new handler:
1. Calls `BridgeLogger.e("CRASH", ...)` with thread name and throwable
2. Calls `DiagnosticsManager.update { copy(lastError = "CRASH [ClassName]: message") }`
3. Re-invokes the previous handler so the system crash dialog still appears

---

## BUG-045 — UdpTransport.sendChannel never closed on disconnect()

**Description**: `UdpTransport.disconnect()` cancelled the `sendJob` coroutine and closed the
socket but never called `sendChannel.close()`. The `Channel<ByteArray>` object (capacity 128)
remained open even after disconnect. On reconnect a fresh `UdpTransport` instance is created,
so the old one's channel and any queued byte arrays were leaked until GC.

**Files involved**: `transport-wifi/.../UdpTransport.kt`

**Priority**: Low (memory leak on each stop/start cycle — no functional impact at typical usage)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 013)
**Fix**: Added `sendChannel.close()` as the first statement in `disconnect()`, before
cancelling `sendJob`, so the channel's iterator terminates cleanly before the coroutine is
cancelled.

---

## BUG-046 — Dead `else` branch in `AccessibilityCommandBus.handleEvent`

**Description**: `AccessibilityCommandBus.handleEvent()` uses a `when (event)` block over the
sealed `InputEvent` hierarchy but includes a trailing `else ->` branch. All 9 direct subtypes of
`InputEvent` (KeyDown, KeyUp, MouseMove, MouseButtonDown, MouseButtonUp, Scroll, TextInput,
ModifierStateChanged, NavigationAction) are explicitly handled above it. The `else` branch is
unreachable dead code and causes the Kotlin compiler to suppress the exhaustiveness check —
meaning future additions to the sealed class will silently compile without a handler, potentially
dropping new event types at runtime.

**Steps to reproduce**: Add a new subclass to `InputEvent`. The compiler will not warn you that
`handleEvent()` is unhandled because `else ->` consumes it silently.

**Expected behavior**: Compiler enforces exhaustiveness; adding a new `InputEvent` subtype causes
a compile error until `handleEvent` handles it.
**Actual behavior**: `else ->` suppresses the check. The dead branch also logs a false-positive
"Unhandled event type" warning if somehow reached.

**Files involved**: `accessibility-receiver/src/main/kotlin/com/inputbridge/accessibility/AccessibilityCommandBus.kt`

**Priority**: Low (no runtime breakage; correctness/maintainability issue)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 014)
**Fix**: Removed the `else ->` branch entirely. Kotlin now enforces exhaustiveness at compile
time for the sealed `InputEvent` hierarchy.

## BUG-047 — `ReceiverService` notification shows empty IP after bridge-silence recovery

**Description**: When the bridge-silence watchdog fires (`bridgeSilenceNotified = true`) and the
bridge subsequently recovers (a PING arrives), the PING handler resets the flag and calls
`updateNotification("Paired with bridge ($pairedBridgeIp)")`. If `pairedBridgeIp` is empty —
which happens when the session is in open mode (no PIN configured, never formally paired) — the
notification reads `"Paired with bridge ()"`.

**Steps to reproduce**: Run receiver with no pairing PIN set. Let the bridge go silent for 15 s,
then reconnect. The persistent notification shows `"Paired with bridge ()"`.

**Expected behavior**: Notification shows a meaningful string regardless of pairing state.
**Actual behavior**: Notification shows the malformed string `"Paired with bridge ()"`.

**Files involved**: `app-receiver/src/main/kotlin/com/inputbridge/receiver/service/ReceiverService.kt`

**Priority**: Low (UX only; no functional impact)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 014)
**Fix**: Guard the notification text: if `pairedBridgeIp.isNotEmpty()` use the existing
`"Paired with bridge ($pairedBridgeIp)"` string; otherwise fall back to
`"Bridge reconnected — PIN: $sessionPin"`.

---

## BUG-048 — `UsbInputCapture.stop()` does not release claimed USB interfaces before closing

**Description**: `UsbInputCapture.start()` calls `conn.claimInterface(iface, true)` for each
HID interface found on the device. `UsbInputCapture.stop()` cancels the capture coroutines and
calls `connection?.close()`, but never calls `conn.releaseInterface(iface)` for any interface it
claimed. On some Android devices and kernel versions, an interface that was not explicitly
released before `close()` remains in a claimed state until an OS-level timeout elapses. This
prevents the interface from being re-opened after a device replug during the same service
lifetime.

**Steps to reproduce**: On affected hardware, unplug the USB receiver while the bridge is
running. `UsbInputCapture.stop()` is called. Replug the receiver within a few seconds.
`UsbInputCapture.start()` → `conn.claimInterface()` may fail silently, leaving the keyboard/
mouse inoperative until the service is restarted.

**Expected behavior**: `stop()` releases all claimed interfaces then closes the connection.
**Actual behavior**: `stop()` closes the connection without releasing interfaces first.

**Files involved**: `input-capture/src/main/kotlin/com/inputbridge/input/UsbInputCapture.kt`

**Priority**: Medium (affects replug reliability on some devices)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 014)
**Fix**: Added `private val claimedInterfaces = mutableListOf<UsbInterface>()`. Each successful
`claimInterface()` call now appends to this list. `stop()` iterates the list calling
`connection?.releaseInterface(iface)` on each entry before calling `connection?.close()`.

---

## BUG-049 — `BridgeService.triggerReconnect()` does not reset `lastCaptureToSendUs`

**Description**: `triggerReconnect()` resets the ping/pong timestamps (`lastPingSentAtMs = 0L`,
`lastPongReceivedMs = 0L`) but does NOT reset the `lastCaptureToSendUs` `AtomicLong`. After a
reconnect, the stale microsecond value from the previous session is flushed into `DiagnosticsData`
every second by `counterFlushJob` until a new input event arrives. The Diagnostics screen will
show a latency figure from the prior session, which can mislead debugging.

**Steps to reproduce**: Bridge session with active keyboard use (e.g. 500 µs capture→send).
Trigger a reconnect (e.g. disconnect Wi-Fi briefly). Before typing again, open the Diagnostics
screen — the capture latency row still shows the old value.

**Expected behavior**: `captureToSendUs` resets to 0 on reconnect.
**Actual behavior**: Stale value from prior session persists until next key/mouse event.

**Files involved**: `app-bridge/src/main/kotlin/com/inputbridge/bridge/service/BridgeService.kt`

**Priority**: Low (cosmetic / diagnostics accuracy; no functional impact)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 014)
**Fix**: Added `lastCaptureToSendUs.set(0L)` alongside the other timestamp resets in
`triggerReconnect()`.

## BUG-050 — `HidReportBuilder.ANDROID_TO_HID` missing `KEYCODE_MENU` and `KEYCODE_F13`–`F24`

**Description**: BUG-038 added `KEYCODE_MENU` (Application/Menu key) and `KEYCODE_F13`–`F24`
to `KeyMap.HID_TO_ANDROID` so that the USB capture path can decode these keys. However, the
inverse map `HidReportBuilder.ANDROID_TO_HID` — used by the Bluetooth HID transport to
re-encode Android key codes into HID usage IDs — was NOT updated. In BT HID mode, pressing
any of these keys causes `onKeyDown()` / `onKeyUp()` to look up a missing key in
`ANDROID_TO_HID`, receive `null`, and silently discard the key. The UDP/accessibility path
(app-receiver) works correctly; only BT HID mode is broken for these keys.

**Missing HID mappings:**
- `KEYCODE_MENU`  → HID 0x65 (Application)
- `KEYCODE_F13`   → HID 0x68
- `KEYCODE_F14`   → HID 0x69
- `KEYCODE_F15`   → HID 0x6A
- `KEYCODE_F16`   → HID 0x6B
- `KEYCODE_F17`   → HID 0x6C
- `KEYCODE_F18`   → HID 0x6D
- `KEYCODE_F19`   → HID 0x6E
- `KEYCODE_F20`   → HID 0x6F
- `KEYCODE_F21`   → HID 0x70
- `KEYCODE_F22`   → HID 0x71
- `KEYCODE_F23`   → HID 0x72
- `KEYCODE_F24`   → HID 0x73

Note: `KEYCODE_SYSRQ`, `KEYCODE_SCROLL_LOCK`, `KEYCODE_BREAK`, and `KEYCODE_INSERT` were already
present in `ANDROID_TO_HID` and are not affected.

**Steps to reproduce**: Bridge in BT HID mode. Press Menu/Application key or any F13–F24 key
on the Portronics keyboard. No key event arrives on the host.

**Expected behavior**: Menu key and F13–F24 work in BT HID mode identically to UDP mode.
**Actual behavior**: Keys silently dropped in BT HID mode.

**Files involved**: `transport-bluetooth-hid/src/main/kotlin/com/inputbridge/transport/bt/HidReportBuilder.kt`

**Priority**: High (complete silent key loss in BT HID mode for a set of valid keys)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 014)
**Fix**: Added all 13 missing entries to `ANDROID_TO_HID`. HID usage IDs sourced from HID
Usage Tables 1.5 (Keyboard/Keypad page 0x07).

## BUG-051 — `FeatureFlags.WIFI_DIRECT_ENABLED = true` but Wi-Fi Direct is a stub

**Description**: `FeatureFlags.WIFI_DIRECT_ENABLED` is `true` by default. The WelcomeScreen
correctly hides the Wi-Fi Direct transport option from the UI, but the flag itself is visible
to any code path that reads it. If any future code reads this flag to conditionally activate
the Wi-Fi Direct transport — which is currently a stub (`WifiDirectTransport`) — it will attempt
to initialize the stub and either fail silently or throw. Shipping with the flag `true` is
misleading and risks accidental activation.

**Files involved**: `shared-core/src/main/kotlin/com/inputbridge/core/config/FeatureFlags.kt`

**Priority**: Low (no current runtime impact; correctness and safety)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 014)
**Fix**: Changed `WIFI_DIRECT_ENABLED` to `false`. The stub remains in the codebase for future
use; the flag will be re-enabled when the transport is implemented.

---

## BUG-052 — `ModifierState.numLock` is always `false` (dead wire)

**Description**: `ModifierState` includes a `numLock: Boolean` field that is serialized into
bit 0x20 of the modifier byte for the wire protocol. However, `UsbInputCapture.parseModifiers()`
never sets `numLock = true`. NumLock LED state comes from USB Output reports (host → device),
which the bridge never processes — the USB HID boot protocol input report (host → device) only
carries modifier key state for Ctrl/Shift/Alt/GUI, not lock-key state. As a result, `numLock`
is always `false` in every `InputEvent`, `ModifierState`, and wire packet; the bit in the
protocol byte is always 0. This is not a correctness issue (numpad number input works
correctly via the regular keycode path), but it is a misleading dead field.

**Files involved**: `shared-core/src/main/kotlin/com/inputbridge/core/model/InputEvent.kt`

**Priority**: Very Low (dead code; no functional impact)
**Status**: ⚠ WONTFIX — Removing `numLock` would change the wire protocol (bit 0x20) and
require a protocol version bump. The field is correctly handled if a future implementation reads
USB Output reports. Leave in place; document here for clarity.

---

## BUG-053 — `DiagnosticsManager.update {}` has a read-modify-write race condition

**Description**: `DiagnosticsManager.update { ... }` is implemented as:
```kotlin
_state.value = _state.value.block()
```
`MutableStateFlow.value` is individually atomic for get and set, but this is a non-atomic
**read-modify-write** sequence: two concurrent callers can both read the same stale value,
apply their independent changes, and then one caller's `set()` overwrites the other's update.
On the hot path this is a real race: `counterFlushJob` (IO thread, every 1 s), `captureJob`
(IO thread, every USB event), and `watchdogJob` (IO thread, every 3–5 s) all call `update`
concurrently. Packets-sent and latency counters can be silently dropped.

**Steps to reproduce**: Sustained bridging session with high keyboard input rate. Compare
`DiagnosticsData.packetsSent` accumulated in `packetsSent` `AtomicLong` with the value shown
in the Diagnostics screen — they will diverge under concurrent flush calls.

**Expected behavior**: All callers see their update committed; no update is lost.
**Actual behavior**: Under concurrent callers, one update can silently overwrite another.

**Files involved**: `diagnostics/src/main/kotlin/com/inputbridge/diagnostics/DiagnosticsManager.kt`

**Priority**: Medium (diagnostic accuracy; no crash, no functional input loss)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 014)
**Fix**: Added `private val updateLock = Any()` and wrapped the read-modify-write in
`synchronized(updateLock) { ... }`. This serializes all callers without blocking the
`MutableStateFlow` collector on Main.
